notes: 
<b>   </b>
<strong>   </strong>
There is nothing different visually between "bold" and "strong" elements. The difference in fact there is that the
"strong" element in addition to making the text bold and also adds emphasis to the text to the blind people.

<i>   </i>
<em>   </em>
The "italic" element and "em" element have the samee relationship. Basically the "em" element also adds emphasis in the
way the "strong" element does and it can be read by text-to-speech programs as well as "strong" element.
